Our data focuses on worldwide layoffs that occurred during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning the period from March 11, 2020, to March 6, 2023.
 We leverage the data cleaning phase to prepare the data for further analysis. This phase ensures the data is accurate and usable before we move on to the exploration stage. The tasks completed during cleaning include:
Removing Duplicates
Standardizing the data
Dealing with Null or empty missing values
Removing Unwanted columns
